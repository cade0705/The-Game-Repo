/*Easter Eggs
*Find an abandonded hotel in the forest and if the player's name is "Trivago" then say that they could use their name to get a great price for a room if it was still open.

*Additional Notes
*Hint at Trivago name - if this is their name ask how the hell they managed to possibly know this was a thing
*Narrator is the final boss - each path has key words that form sentence to defeat his final while loop attack
*Add something to every path that hints at a response to give in a different path
*If their name is moron at the end of the game, they can't win anyways (from counter variable)
*Make a room of easter eggs so that the player can discover all of them
